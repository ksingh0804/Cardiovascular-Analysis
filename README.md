# Cardiovascular-Analysis
#### The main aim of my project is to predict the certainty of a person to have this deadly disease based on various parameters such as age, gender, healthy habits, etc so that this disease can be predicted before it becomes critical and be treated with normal measures and no lives are lost. I have made some progress in predicting the probability of a person to have this disease based on the data set to be about 72% effective. This result is just based on a single model.
